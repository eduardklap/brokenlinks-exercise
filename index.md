## README exercise 

Exercise as part of the [Responsible Research Data Management course](https://www.egsh.eur.nl/doctoral-education/phd-course-guide/responsible-research-data-management-rdm/) at the Erasmus Graduate School for Social Sciences and the Humanities (EGSH). During this exercise you will write a README file for your research project.  

## Instructions -  During the course session (30 minutes)

#### Download and open the README template
- Download the [README_template.txt](https://github.com/eduardklap/readme-exercise/files/8715518/README_template.txt)
file. 
- Open the file as plain text, using a text editor, like Notepad/TextEdit/Vim, **not** Word. Save your file as a `.txt` file.
- _If you feel comfortable with Markdown, you can use the file [README_template.md](https://github.com/eduardklap/readme-exercise/files/8715526/README_template.md) with [Markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) in your text._

#### Fill the template with your project specific details
- For now, we start with a README for the entire project, in the root of the project folder.
- Provide as much information as possible under the headings in the template (general info, sharing/access info, data & file overview, et cetera). Be sure to be as explicit as possible with the provided information, such that someone unfamiliar with your project can understand the details. See also feedback criteria below for inspiration what to include.
- Ask for help when needed, we are happy to support you! 

## Instructions - After the course session (1-2 hours)

#### Finish your project README draft
- Do not take more than 1 hour for this! The README does not have to be finished.
- Aim for at least some parts to be understandable for someone not familiar with your project.

#### Send the draft README to another participant
- You will receive an email to inform you about the course participant with whom you form a pair
- Send the draft README **not later than Friday May 20 at 5pm** to your partner, so that they can provide feedback. If this is not possible, you can arrange a different time with your partner.

#### Provide feedback on the README of another participant
- Read through the README that you received from your partner
- Ask yourself the following: Is it clear when and where the research took place? Will you know where to find specific files when aiming to reproduce results? Do you know what specific software to use? Are details provided about variables and measurements?
- Send a short list of improvements to your partner **not later than Tuesday May 24 at 4pm**
