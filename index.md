Exercise as part of the [Responsible Research Data Management course](https://www.egsh.eur.nl/doctoral-education/phd-course-guide/responsible-research-data-management-rdm/) at the Erasmus Graduate School for Social Sciences and the Humanities (EGSH). During this exercise you will try to relocate internet sources from a list of actual sources used in journal articles.  

## Exercise instructions
The list of the broken links that Gertler and Bullock found in the *American Political Science Review* is available (in a data repository with a PID):  
Bullock, John, 2017, "Reference Rot: An Emerging Threat to Transparency in Political Science", [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/Q8VDN0](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/Q8VDN0), Harvard Dataverse, V1

### Download and open the list of URLs
- Download the [brokenReproducibilityURLs.tab](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/Q8VDN0/O1DXFS&version=1.0) file from the repository
- Open the file in a spreadsheet program such as Excel

### Inspection of the missing resources
- Find the first five links marked as “Did not find resource”
- What sorts of websites are these? 

### Using the Internet Archive
- Can you still find the linked content from these first five links using the [Internet Archive’s Way Back Machine](https://archive.org/web/)?

### Bonus question
- Find the first five links that were marked as “Found resource” in 2016. How many of these are still currently accessible?

## Background
Online sources may disappear at some point. For example, more than half of the reproducibility links in articles from the *American Political Science Review* between 2000 and 2013 couldn’t be accessed in 2016 ([Gertler & Bullock, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096516002353), 167). Similarly, although providing links to data in Data Availability Statements lead to much better retrieval rates than contacting authors to locate data, still 20% of URLs were unavailable in one study ([Federer, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272845))  

Saving local copies of materials is good but insufficient for transparency. Also, often copies of data cannot be shared through a repository because of copyright issues. In that case it is better to directly link to the original source.  

**Solutions:**
- When available, use a persistent and resolvable identifier (PID): a long-lasting reference to a digital object that gives information about that object regardless of what happens to it. Examples of PIDs include [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](https://www.doi.org/), [Handle](https://www.handle.net/), and [Archival Resource Key (ARK)](https://arks.org/)
- Use internet archiving services for webpages (especially the Internet Archive: [https://archive.org/web/](https://archive.org/web/))
